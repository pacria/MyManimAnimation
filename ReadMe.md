MyManimAnimation is a repo that contains some small practice through [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), I decide to divide it by two parts, one is **tutorial** including notes and basic demonstration, and the other is some **changllanges** exploring every possibilities.

+ Hello, world

  The most basic workflow about using `Manim`

+ Positions:

  Basic methods to arrange objects.  Adjust their position and relative relationship in the picture

+ Basic Geometry:

  `Mobjects`, `VMojbects` and their subclass related to geometry objects like `Line`, `Arc`, `Pylomial`, etc.

+ More `Mobjects`

  Like `NumberLine`, `Grid`, ... The point is that you need to get them in a `VGroup`, we will use them while learning `VGroup` , and finally, try to create your own simple `Mobject`.

  P.S. Sometimes, you may want to learn the deep logic about the `Mobject`, and then we need to know the concept of *Bezier curve*, trust me, this is not hard. Maybe you want to rewrite the `Circle`  or something equally interesting!

+ Transforms

  You may know many effects like `FadeInFromDown`, `ShowCreation`, they are all subclasses to `Transform`, learn how the `Transform` works from every detailed examples.

+ Graph

  About *2D* scenes and *3D* scenes

+ `Updater` and `ValueTracker`

  `Updater` are the function that express the interaction, as the `ValueTracker` can help it.

+ `Alpha` Parameter

+ Advance Part:  The structure of `Scene` and `Camera`
+ Advance Part:  About *path*
+ Advance Part:  The very beginning `Container`  -- how to design a  well-formed base-class
+ Advance Part:  Go deeper into `rotate`, `flip`, etc. Linear operation using `numpy`
+ Advance Part:   Write $LaTex$ using `python`
+ Advance Part:   About *ffmpeg*
+ Advance Part:   Acquirements to make a video
